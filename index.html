                    <h3>The Austrian Oak</h3>
                    <p>Born in Thal, Austria on July 30, 1947, Arnold Schwarzenegger began weight training at the age of 15. By age 20, he was dominating bodybuilding competitions and won the title of Mr. Universe in 1967, becoming the youngest ever to win the prestigious competition.</p>
                    <p>Throughout his bodybuilding career, Schwarzenegger won the Mr. Olympia contest seven times (1970-1975, 1980) and the Mr. Universe title five times. His rivalry with fellow bodybuilder Lou Ferrigno was later dramatized in the documentary "Pumping Iron" (1977), which helped bring bodybuilding into the mainstream.</p>
                    <p>Schwarzenegger's revolutionary training techniques, charismatic personality, and unprecedented physique forever changed the sport of bodybuilding. His book "The Encyclopedia of Modern Bodybuilding" remains a definitive resource for bodybuilders worldwide.</p>

                    <h3>From Bodybuilder to Action Star</h3>
                    <p>Schwarzenegger's breakthrough in Hollywood came with "Conan the Barbarian" (1982), but it was his iconic role as the Terminator in James Cameron's 1984 sci-fi classic that cemented his status as an action star. The phrase "I'll be back" became one of the most quoted movie lines in film history.</p>
                    <p>Throughout the 1980s and 1990s, Schwarzenegger dominated the box office with hits like "Predator" (1987), "Total Recall" (1990), "Terminator 2: Judgment Day" (1991), and "True Lies" (1994). He also showed his versatility with comedic roles in films like "Twins" (1988) and "Kindergarten Cop" (1990).</p>
                    <p>Despite critics initially doubting his acting abilities due to his accent and physique, Schwarzenegger became one of Hollywood's highest-paid actors and a global cultural icon. His films have grossed more than $4 billion worldwide, and he continues to appear in major productions.</p>

                    <h3>The Governator</h3>
                    <p>In a surprising career pivot, Schwarzenegger announced his candidacy for Governor of California in the 2003 recall election. Running as a Republican with moderate views, he won the election and was sworn in as the 38th Governor of California on November 17, 2003.</p>
                    <p>During his two terms as governor (2003-2011), Schwarzenegger focused on environmental issues, healthcare reform, and infrastructure improvement. He signed the Global Warming Solutions Act of 2006, establishing the first comprehensive greenhouse gas regulation program in the United States, and pushed for healthcare reform in the state.</p>
                    <p>Despite facing challenges including budget deficits and the 2008 financial crisis, Schwarzenegger maintained relatively high approval ratings. After leaving office in 2011, he has remained politically active, particularly on environmental issues and political reform.</p>

                    <p>Schwarzenegger married television journalist Maria Shriver, niece of President John F. Kennedy, in 1986. The couple had four children together before separating in 2011. Schwarzenegger later acknowledged that he had fathered a child with a household employee, which led to their divorce.</p>
                    <p>Throughout his life, Schwarzenegger has been involved in numerous philanthropic efforts. He has served as chairman of the President's Council on Physical Fitness and Sports, has been a prominent Special Olympics supporter, and founded the After-School All-Stars program, which provides comprehensive after-school programs for children in need.</p>
                    <p>In recent years, Schwarzenegger has focused on environmental activism, promoting fitness, and supporting various charitable causes. He regularly shares fitness advice and political commentary through social media platforms and his newsletter.</p>
